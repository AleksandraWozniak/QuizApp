# QuizApp

This is just a practice app for the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships">Google Developer Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics</a> I received for the Android Basics path. 

The requirements were to create a quiz layout with at least four different Views, and a method that verifies the answers and displays the final results in a Toast. I chose to present seven questions about movies, using free text answers, checkboxes, and radio buttons.

I also added answers in "help".
